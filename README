QR-Code generator v0.1 (c) 2023 Jouni Korhonen

A python3 package to generate QR-Codes for self learning purposes. Not
styled or otherwise efficient solution. Sorry for lack of comments :)

Support:
* Versions from 1 to 40 are supported.
* Encoding modes:
  - Numeric
  - Alphanumeric
  - Byte
  - Kanji in not really there yet and others are just neglected.

Some notes:
* The quiet zone is not part of the output QR-Code.

How to use:

Import qrcoder from path qr and them look into the test.py how
to proceed..

The following files constitute the QR-Code generator:
  qr/galois.py      - Implementation of polynomial division using Galois Fields.
  qr/phrasecoder.py - Encoding of input phrase.
  qr/qrcoder.py     - All the rest of QR-Code encoding.
  qr/qrpenalty.py   - Implements the 4 penalty algorights.
  test.py           - A test program driving the QR-Code generation
  asm/qrcoder.asm   - A Z80 assembly implementation of the 3-L QR-Code
                      generation. Not a speed wonder if you choose auto mask
                      selection.

Thanks to following great tutorials and online encoders
for providing testing possibility:
