A python3 package to generate QR-Codes for self learning purposes. Not
styled or otherwise efficient solution. Sorry for lack of comments :)

Some notes:
* The quiet zone is not part of the output QR-Code.

How to use:

Import qrcoder from path qr and them look into the test.py how
to proceed..

The following files constitute the QR-Code generator:
  qr/galois.py      - Implementation of polynomial division using Galois Fields.
  qr/phrasecoder.py - Encoding of input phrase.
  qr/qrcoder.py     - All the rest of QR-Code encoding.
  qr/qrpenalty.py   - Implements the 4 penalty algorights.
